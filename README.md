# METHODOLOGY
1.Using Foursquare API to get different types of restaurant that exist within each city's
neighborhood. The Foursquare API allows application developers to interact with the
Foursquare platform. The API itself is a RESTful set of addresses to which you can send requests,
so there's really nothing to download onto your server. The Foursquare Places API provides
location-based experiences with diverse information about venues, users, photos, and check-ins.
